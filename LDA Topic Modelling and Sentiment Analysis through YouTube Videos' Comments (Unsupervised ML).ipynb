A silent and dangerous invasion. And in 15 years time the government will regret their choices of accepting those people into Irish shores. People who go to Ireland for business, investor and students, they are really welcomed there. And I know the people on the streets are fine with those. Language students bring Billions to the country every year. Investor are necessary everywhere, and highly skilled workers who want to live there, they want because they love the country. They want to be part of the culture, and not change it like those refugees. And they are law abiding citizens, who payed to deserve a place in Ireland.  I know because I was an English student in Ireland for few years (from Brazil). And I loved the country and it\\'s people with all my heart. Everyone was so nice to me, the place was so beautiful and safe. But I saw the place changing so quickly in such a short time when this wave of so called refugees started to appear out of nowhere. They were rude, dangerous looking, didn\\'t work, didn\\'t respect anything or anyone, and where giving better care than the poorest and the elderly in Ireland. So sad and I feel the rage that Irish people are feeling right now. All those Syrian men, we know they aren\\'t good people. If they aren\\'t removed from Ireland, soon they will start committing serious crimes against Irish women, and soon the whole society in Ireland will change to an irreversible point. I\\'m not against refugees (women and children). But all those strong and health men? Please!

I emigrated as a teenager from rural Cork in 1961. The process took about 2 yrs. because mother’s chest X-ray was suspicious . The paperwork was laborious and included NY relatives guaranteeing in writing to be responsible for us financially if needed. The very idea of any government aid was unthinkable. A few weeks after arriving in NY my mother was working as a hotel maid. My sister still lives in Glasnevin…a retired Teacher who is a nun. We have frequent conversations about this very issue. Unbridled immigration will ruin my beautiful homeland. America did not allow immigrants for purely altruistic reasons. Cheap labor was needed everywhere. The Irish built bridges,skyscrapers, railroads etc and discovered that the streets were not paved with gold but with sweat and blood. A lot of Irish blood was spilled in America’s endless wars!! England is already a densely populated country. More people means less beauty and more asphalt / cement jungle. Keep protesting and insist on immigration caps. Refugee status should be very narrow also. I really do miss the green green grass of home.\\nRead more\\n63\\nReply\\n1 reply\\nchristopher ward\\n2 months ago\\nWell done you Irish  there is something wrong when your government, the government which is supposed to represent you, is putting these 1st \\n314\\nReply\\n5 replies\\nEamonn Byrne\\n2 months ago\\nIt\\'s about time the Irish people stand up and be counted and look after their own homeless first.

The people pay maintenance fees and big mortgages or rents for a once lovely safe place to live.  Now they can’t sell up coz who would buy an apartment where you share courtyard with unvented men from totally different mindsets and cultures.  Talking to these men they told men they’d crossed over 15 countries to eventually arrive here.  Where are their wives and kids?  The office looks down over the bedrooms of the apartment.  Another 500 will be installed up the road, happening all over Ireland and Dublin.  Communities are abandoned by the politicians of course.

Illegal economic migrants (aka freeloaders) arrive across the channel by boat from France and our criminally inept government puts them into warm, comfy hotels with all found plus spending money. Meanwhile, we have British citizens sleeping on the streets, one-third of pensioners are below the poverty line (figure from Institute of Fiscal Studies), and one-third of children live below the poverty line (figure from Joseph Rowntree Foundation). It costs 1.3 BILLION pounds sterling to keep those boat people in comfort.....£4,300 per month EACH!

I emigrated as a teenager from rural Cork in 1961. The process took about 2 yrs. because mother’s chest X-ray was suspicious . The paperwork was laborious and included NY relatives guaranteeing in writing to be responsible for us financially if needed. The very idea of any government aid was unthinkable. A few weeks after arriving in NY my mother was working as a hotel maid. My sister still lives in Glasnevin…a retired Teacher who is a nun. We have frequent conversations about this very issue. Unbridled immigration will ruin my beautiful homeland. America did not allow immigrants for purely altruistic reasons. Cheap labor was needed everywhere. The Irish built bridges,skyscrapers, railroads etc and discovered that the streets were not paved with gold but with sweat and blood. A lot of Irish blood was spilled in America’s endless wars!! England is already a densely populated country. More people means less beauty and more asphalt / cement jungle. Keep protesting and insist on immigration caps. Refugee status should be very narrow also. I really do miss the green green grass of home.\\nRead more\\n65\\nReply\\n2 replies\\nViolet Lee\\n3 months ago\\nSo good to see the brave people of Ireland standing up to this takeover of our land.

Uncapped , free for all immigration while the Irish have no where left to rent or buy an affordable house. Free homes handed to those entering from foreign lands while the native irish are put on housing lists or simply leave.  It's sickening to see this happen !\", 'As a Brit I feel sorry for our Irish cousins it will decimate Irelands beautiful ancient culture, we all suffer at the hands of these globalist hippys.', 'Since Irish government gave local government to buy houses for them there no struggle. Free houses for anybody other than Irish. We should be proud of our great leaders Leo and Mehole', 'While I feel for refugees,  our own people struggling should come first !', \"Britain and Ireland will soon end up with a government similar to Sweden and Denmark. Those latter two countries' citizens are utterly fed up with the whole migrant situation which their own gevernments have allowed to happen.\", 'Why not mention about 30000 Irish families with no home and nowhere available to rent or all the hotels full of refugees', \"NGO's need jailed for what they are doing to these island's.\", 'Now the Irish people can also say, they too were never asked. \\nThe Irish government is doing what the British government has done to its people and forced an endless tide of foreigners on its indigenous population.', 'They just need to come clean and just say we can\\'t take anymore. Even though Leo the Leak said not long ago \" We can take in 250,000 , or more\". The irish government should be looking after us first and not everyone that isn\\'t irish first. Seems that Irish people will have to claim asylum status in their own country to get anything.', 'Politicians need to be make clear, we do NOT want these people here and to get rid of immediately, stuff the U.N. and EU.', 'It’s even more worrying for Ireland as it’s a small country & nation, in ten years time from their culture will not be the same the indigenous Irish could end up being a minority in their own land .', 'No mattress’s or blankets awwww Jaysus that’s awful!! Maybe if they ask the Irish people living in boxes in shop doorways they’ll share wit them ', 'I love my country Ireland \\nBut good god do I loath my government and the alternatives..', \"A major factor is that the Republic is struggling under a spectacular housing and homelessness crisis at the moment, so there isn't the housing and accomodation stock available to release the pressure, and support such people.\", 'Reminds me of the guy interviewing pro asylum seekers in the U.K. and and none of them could house any themselves.', 'This is proof the policy is working. Though we should be doing more for the Ukrainian refugees by shipping out the illegal migrants from hotels and making room for real refugees 🇺🇦', 'This immigrant problem needs sorting out now. The right to claim Asylum should be abolished along with the ECHR, then big deportations.', 'Honestly, why are we taking in so much when we are already struggling at home.', 'Martin should blame the French for allowing all the refuges to hang around its ports, just waiting for a chance to cross the channel. And when they take their chance the French do bugger all to stop them.', \"Ireland never blames the EU or its  membership in it for anything. It's alway the fault of the UK.\", 'We are second class citizens in our own country. We can’t look after ourselves, never mind others ffs. A pity of country made by a government full of snakes ', 'The Rwanda scheme is actually working I see. It’s forcing immigrants to travel to different countries ', 'The young Irish are leaving to find work, and Asylum Seekers want to live in Ireland!', 'Lol let’s just blame the UK for every single problem in the world whilst looking to the UK to solve every problem and again still hating the UK no matter wot they do , here is a question why cannot every country work together to solve or help this problem instead of just playing the blame game', 'Considering the social housing pressures in Ireland, it could take decades to rehouse these refugees, once the honey moon period ends they’ll wished they’ve gone to Rwanda.', 'So the Irish are allowed to complain about legitimate Ukrainian refugees (and to blame the UK at that), but the UK is not within its rights to attempt to contain, control, or police in the slightest, illegal economic French migrants.\\nHypocrisy at its finest.', 'Stop housing them Dingle crossing, stop giving them £40 pw .

So if they are going to Ireland instead, it's working.\", 'I watched a video on youtube a few days ago. The vlogger went to the airport and started to interview a bunch of men from Ukraine they said they were born in Pakistan but were all Ukrainian and 60 years old. One only looked about 25 none looked older than 50. None could speak Russian or Ukrainian. I have lived in Ukraine and was there visiting this year before the war started, and only saw a handful Asians. Yet at Dublin airport there’s loads', 'They wouldn’t do this for the Irish homeless.. but they will for Ukrainians ??

We all accept they have legal obligations but who is protecting the natives?', 'Try going on holidays in Ireland now!\\nThose who can/could afford it will be spending a pretty penny in the few places that they can find accommodation.', 'Well there’s a surprise! 19 homeless Irish died in Dublin in a month. Where on earth is the fairness? I’m Irish and I can’t get a property ! Because Black rock bought up all properties .', \"It's continuing to get worse not better months on from this report. Ireland still has a serious housing crisis that will affect people for years to come yet we still have a mass of asylum seekers, Ukranians and immigrants seeking work arriving in large numbers every year. It's become impossible to find shared rented accommodation now for indigenous as well as the newcomers.\", \"Glad it's having an effect. Ireland has been taking up to 1000 Ukrainians a day...of course they would run out. Filled hotels such as City West outside Dublin and are crucifying the travel trade. They really didn't think anything through and now blame the UK.\", \"Still can't understand how people can continue claim refugee status when they have already entered a country of which has already given them a safe heaven\", 'Its mainly the fault of the Irish red cross, had to go through a bunch of verification processes to get a Ukrainian family to live with us, took close to 2 months before we could do our vetting process and then we heard nothing back after that.', \"Remember, it's the default position of Ireland to blame the British for their problems\", 'Great to see some genuine refugees for a change instead of fake ones on boats.', 'History always repeats itself. Remember in 2014 when the Islamic State strike Middle East, a lot of migrants crossed the border going to Germany and Sweden? Now, it seems like we are in a similar situation though.', 'made me laugh its a crises when we have to house refugees in tents but its ok for our own homeless to stay in tents', 'Can’t even find housing for your own people ', 'The replacement strategy in full swing.', \"and some  politicians pro mass migration  and extreme changes to the Irish culture taditions and ways of lifes still encouraging mass migration to Ireland..\\noften paying Asylum seekers, refugees  all benefits of all sorts  Refugees are occupying many hotels and B&B hardly any spaces for tourists...that's why the government now is building tents and all.\", 'Absolutely disgusting, If I lived in Ireland I’d be pissed as well… all these waifs and strays coming over… something bad will happen here, possibly civil war and unrest…', 'Ukraine is a huge country, with resources well beyond what Ireland has. I dont believe for one second that their refugees could not have been accommodated in their own country. Any Ukrainian serious about going home after the war will go to Moldova, the ones who come to the west are honestly taking the mick, most will stay here forever and take advantage of us as mugs!', 'Immigration,the reason the British public voted to leave the EU.', 'We should close our borders and tell the UN and EU where to go with  their migration policies.', 'In UK they were indignant when someone suggested they eat value brands to fight inflation?? They nearly fainted when someone suggested they could join us in UK in agricultural seasonal work. They insult Rwanda by suggesting its an injustice to be sent there? Why all these posh daft reactions?? (Afterthought - a sports hall is for the benefit of the local community to play sports??)', 'Fantastic the Rwanda policy is working better than even I expected. Also Ukrainian refugees are exempt from deportation to Rwanda so pull the other one that they are Ukrainians.', 'What about all these so called young men of fighting age from Arabic countries being let in taking over hotels, and houses, when the Irish Government can’t look after it’s Own citizens, This is a disgrace the people have enough.🇨🇮, send them all back.', \"*Literally any problem*\\nIreland: it's the British's fault\\n\\nSame goes for Scotland lol\", 'What the guy meant when he said the immigrants would go to other countries he actually meant mainland UK. Just thought I would clear that up.', \"I predicted months ago Shanty towns springing up to accommodate migrants, I'm sure this will happen all over the UK very soon.\", 'What business is it of the RoI if the UK wants to send illegal immigrants elsewhere? I’ve never seen so much anti-Britishness coming from the RoI as I have in the last couple of years.', 'I love the way he blames the Brits, even after 100 years of independence they blame us for everything.', \"Its been happening in Britain for year's\", \"Cost of living strikes again. Latest figure is 4000 stuck in direct provision because they, like many people, can't find somewhere they can afford to rent. Decades of leaving it to the market and not building social homes leaves us not able to handle day to day, nevermind the shock of a war\", \"It's simple to fix this problem stop taking them it's that simple\", 'What is it with all these weak leaders needing to blame everyone else for their problems', \"Ireland can handle whatever comes it's way ️🇮🇪\", 'Those tents look equal to or better than the average Irish rental.', 'I could never imagine migrants crossing the Irish Sea from Britain to Ireland, Britain just would not allow this so how is France permitting this ', 'We have plenty of room here - for up to 40 million or more . We could turn the country into one big camp. It would be like a big,never ending,sleepover party.It should be a great laugh in the next pandemic with the social distancing. Always remember  -  Diversity is our strength !', 'And what about there own people on the streets.', 'Ireland going in the same trap as Sweden,good luck.\\nAllready now we see how that works in small villages in Ireland', \"No offence to refugees and foreigners but the Irish government should be more focused on it's own people in the north of Ireland known as the Six Counties or Northern Ireland and the immediate reunification of it's citizens which they left behind 100 years ago in the War of independence.\", \"I'm sure the French Navy are happily escorting them across into Irish waters\", \"They just can't help themselves from blaming the British .\", 'Michael blame everybody else Martin at it again not having the intelligence to think of a solution to the problem instead he just blames the potential causes of it.', 'Referendum on Immigration, Ireland.

It is not the economic migrants the uk are getting. The comments about the use of rawanda are a bit rich as the eu uses rawanda.

The Irish people are the best people in the world, no one ever helped us the way we have helped others. We almost got wiped out 150 years ago.', \"Irish people sleep on the streets in the rain..

We already have a HUGH influx of migrants coming into this country our hotels is full the housing list a damn crisis Irish people homeless and the government is doing nothing about any of this other then helping Ukrainians and other foreigners. it was hard enough for a Irish person to get a job if they are homeless it was hard enough to get a house or any place for that matter and rent is sky rocketing. but NOW the Irish is being dumped on the housing list further down to accommodate for the Ukrainians  putting them first as urgent  and forcing many many more Irish to become homeless the rents too high forcing even more homeless and what\\'s the government doing about it? nothing. The Ukrainians have free schools ((there kids is getting free uniforms while Irish parents pay for there kids uniforms)) free travel passes even though most is not disabled. there first when it comes to getting a house on the housing list. haven\\'t the Irish done enough for the Ukrainians at this point? now they want more jobs for them great how many Irish will have to lose a job for them??? the whole government is a damn disgrace. now people say oh why don\\'t the men fight I can say the same about some of the women as well just not the kids)) over 70.000 Ukrainians alone are being housed by the end of this year so think about it even if we say 50,000 of them is young men that can fight for the country what about the other 20,000 women and kids? sorry but if your able to bare arms you should fight for your country man or women ((not kids)). the primary schools want to bring in the Ukraine LANGUAGE now and have kids learn it. however the mothers have spoken out against it and I say fair play to them even going so far as to say if they start teaching there kids Ukraine language they will pull there kids out of the class and tell them to leave the classroom. if you don\\'t like it whether your Ukrainian or even any migrant for that matter then LEAVE THE DAMN COUNTRY AND GO BACK HOME!.

Social benefits for refugees here the highest if to compare with another countries. Now Ukrainian authorities ask people try don't back at least for winter time to their country  Ukraine don't overuse electricity, gas, water as now big problem with that after destroying some infrastructure. For Ukrainian government as more people will be abroad is better. They send money home and such way will help to rebuild country. Irish government must think about their own people first, and there problems here as well. How many people are homeless, how many people are waiting for housing,  hospitals without beds. By the way, some Ukrainian refugees put their apartments or houses for rent for big money, but here, in Ireland looking for free accommodation and benefits.
